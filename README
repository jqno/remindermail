ReminderMail
------------

ReminderMail is an Android app that will let you quickly send e-mail to a pre-defined address.
This is useful to quickly send reminders to yourself, or to an online ToDo-list application such as [NirvanaHq](http://www.nirvanahq.com).

Instructions for use:
* Make sure you have a contact for the e-mail address you want to use.
* Open the ReminderMail Configuration app and select the contact.
* Move the ReminderMail app icon to your home screen.

Now you can send yourself or your ToDo app quick reminders, either by opening the app from the home screen, or by sharing a page to "@ ReminderMail".

Note that ReminderMail only supports one e-mail address.
