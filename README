ReminderMail
---------

ReminderMail is an Android app that will let you quickly send e-mail to a pre-defined address.
This is useful to quickly send reminders to yourself, or to an online ToDo-list application (such as [NirvanaHq](http://www.nirvanahq.com)).

Move the icon to your home screen for easy access, or share pages via "@ ReminderMail".

Note that ReminderMail only supports one e-mail address.

If you want to report an issue, or contact the author, send an e-mail to jqno.android@gmail.com
